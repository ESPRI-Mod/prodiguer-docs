ESGF integration
================

`ESG-F`_ is an international distribution and analysis portal for climate data. `ESG-F`_ is based on a distributed architecture with federated network. The system is composed of multiple sites called "nodes". These sites are geographically distributed worldwide and communicate through services, common protocols and APIs. Data and metadata are stored independently on each node and clients can access it like a single global archive.
